***What equipment do you need for your podcast?***

In order to start a podcast, all you need is a microphone, headphones, and a computer. If you want to go a step further to get better quality sound, you may need some extra hardware. We listed a few of those below with a brief description of what they do, and made 3 lists with our recommendations, depending on your level of expertise, and budget.

**Microphone:** This is the very first thing that comes to everyone's mind, since this is what you will speak into to record your voice.

**Mixer:** A mixer is a great addition to any setup, since it helps you level and compress your audio, producing a better quality sound.

**Headphones:** Another very straightforward hardware you will need, headphones are used to monitor your audio. Plug them into a mixer, or your computer, and listen carefully how is your audio coming out. We highly recommend over-the-ear headphones for better sound insulation.

**Boom Arm:** Even if this is not necessary, it will help keep your workspace clean, and makes it easier to position your microphone.

**Shock Mount:** Shock mounts reduce the amount of vibrations and noise your microphone may pick up.

**Pop Filters:** There are several different types of pop filters. In general, they act as a barrier between you and your microphone, helping reduce noice noise, and helps prevent plosives from hitting the microphone.

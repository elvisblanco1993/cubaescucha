> Currently there are no music licenses that cover podcasts, so what music can you use?

Podcasts are an on-demand audio format and are downloadable by nature. Because of this, no licensing exists for podcasts. They also cannot be geographically restricted. This been said, we would recommend you to stay out of using copyrighted music and use one of the following options instead.

#### Free Music

If you can't pay for your podcast's music just yet, there is plenty of free music available online. Most of this is published under [Creative Commons Licensing](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/), which clearly states what you can and cannot do with each track. Here are a few places you can look for free music:

- [Free Sound](https://freesound.org/)
- [Free Music Archive](https://www.freemusicarchive.org/)
- [Free Stock Music](https://www.freestockmusic.com/)

#### Paid Music

There are also paid libraries where you can license some awesome tracks for your podcast. Other libraries offer a paid subscription service, and you get unlimited access to their entire database of music. Check out these options:

- [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/)
- [Audio Jungle](https://www.bensound.com/)
- [Epidemic Sound](https://www.epidemicsound.com/)
